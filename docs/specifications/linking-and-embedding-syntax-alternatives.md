# Linking and Embedding Syntax Alternatives

## Anchors

- **Alternative 1**: Normal HTML elements
  - Examples:
    - `<a name="some-anchor"></a>`
    - `<a id="some-anchor"></a>`
    - `<a id="some-anchor"/>`
    - `<span id="some-anchor"></span>`
  - Pros:
    - Just HTML
    - Doesn't get rendered into any output by default
    - Works without any further work (?)
  - Cons:
    - Subjectively ugly
    - Somewhat verbose
    - In case enclosing tag is not used, gets sometimes rendered incorrectly(?)
- **Alternative 2**: Empty links
  - Examples:
    - `[](some-anchor)`
  - Pros:
    - Concise
    - Doesn't get rendered into any output by default
  - Cons:
    - Kind of misuse of links ("interpret link without text as anchor")
    - Might be confusing to users
- **Alternative 3**: Markdown attribute extensions
  - Examples:
    - `{#some-anchor}`
  - Pros:
    - Concise
    - Pretty (?)
  - Cons:
    - As default gets rendered as such everywhere
    - Is this supported anywhere? Discussed e.g. [here](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/anchors-in-markdown/247/32)
- **Alternative 4**: Letter-prefix anchors
  - Examples:
    - `§some-anchor`
  - Pros:
    - Cannot be anymore Concise
    - As pretty as it gets (?)
  - Cons:
    - As default gets rendered as such everywhere
    - Not supported anywhere, requires foam specific tooling
    - Which letter to use to not mix it with anything else - make configurable?
- **Alternative 5**: LinkRefDef blocks
  - Examples:
    - `[foam:block]: some-anchor`
  - Pros:
    - Doesn't get rendered in any output
  - Cons:
    - "Misuse" of linkrefdefs
    - Cannot be used inline
    - Might be confusing when mixed with other linkrefdefs
- **Alternative 6**: Bookkeeping on the side
  - No examples since there's no syntax
  - Would require some kind of file on the side that can be manipulated via editor (vscode) e.g. by right-clicking the position in the note and selecting "add anchor" and giving it an id. Position and id would be stored into separate file.
  - Would require visualizing these on top of the text editor
  - Pros:
    - No syntax, note is always easy to read in its raw format
  - Cons:
    - Might be brutally hard to implement (consider all the possibilities of delete / modify / move / copy-paste and use of external editors)
    - Might lock the user to vscode (+ other supported editors)
    - Markdown file is not anymore the single source of truth

## Embedding

Note that all the alternatives below require special processing to get embeds showing in published artifacts. It's also not clear if it's a benefit that syntax used for embedding gets rendered as such if the renderer doesn't support it.

- **Alternative 1**: Wikilink with additions
  - Examples:
    - `![[some-anchor]]`
  - Notes:
    - Gets rendered by default
    - Looks like wikilink-syntax
    - Looks like image syntax, which is kind of embedding
    - Supported by vscode-memo (for full notes)
- **Alternative 2**: Empty links
  - Examples:
    - `[](>some-anchor)` (add prefix to anchor name to denote embedding)
  - Notes:
    - Doesn't get rendered by default
    - In case empty links would be used for anchors, syntax would be similar
- **Alternative 3**: Letter-prefix embeds
  - Examples:
    - `§§some-anchor`
  - Notes:
    - Can be one or more letters (in the example, repeats the letter of the anchor)
    - Gets rendered by default
    - As concise as it gets
